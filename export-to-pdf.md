# How to Export the Presentation to PDF

Since the presentation is created as HTML files, you'll need to convert them to PDF format. Here are detailed instructions:

## Method 1: Using Chrome or Edge (Recommended)

1. Open the `index.html` file in Chrome or Edge
2. For each slide (index.html, slide1.html, slide2.html, etc.):
   - Open the file in your browser
   - Press `Ctrl+P` (or `Cmd+P` on Mac)
   - Change destination to "Save as PDF"
   - Set "Pages" to "All"
   - Click "Save" and choose a location like "slide1.pdf", "slide2.pdf", etc.

3. Combine the PDFs:
   - Use a PDF tool like Adobe Acrobat, PDF-XChange Editor, or online services like smallpdf.com
   - Merge the individual slide PDFs into a single document
   - Save the combined file as "AHP_Mod_2.0_Presentation.pdf"

## Method 2: Using a PDF Printer

1. Install a PDF printer like "Microsoft Print to PDF" (built into Windows) or "PDF Creator"
2. Open each HTML file in your browser
3. Print each page to the PDF printer
4. Combine the resulting PDFs as described above

## Method 3: Using Online HTML to PDF Services

1. Use an online service like "HTML to PDF" converters
2. Upload each HTML file (you may need to upload the images separately)
3. Convert and download each PDF
4. Combine the PDFs into a single document

## PDF Navigation Features

Once you have the combined PDF:

1. Most PDF viewers provide navigation controls:
   - Arrow keys for next/previous page
   - Page thumbnails in the sidebar
   - Page number input box

2. For better navigation, consider adding bookmarks in your PDF editor:
   - Create bookmarks for each slide
   - Name them according to the slide titles
   - This creates a clickable table of contents in the sidebar
